Subject: *URGENT* Help with Invoices!

Here's a program someone wrote to figure out if any of our customers underpaid. 
In the past, our office admin Mark would literally open the log file and scan 
for any new customers. If he found any, he would proceed to change the code so 
that there would be another "If statement" for that new customer.

There are two things to mention at this point...

1. Mark just got poached by Squysh! Which mean, now we need you to be responsible 
   for manually scanning the log file for customers, and then seeing if any have 
   underpaid for their delcious melons.

2. GREAT NEWS!!! Our twitter marketing campaign was a huge success 
   and Melon Soldier(tm) has gotten us a massive amount of sign ups. So instead 
   of just three customers, by the end of today it looks like the log file will 
   have THOUSANDS!

Oh so, unfortunately... yeah... we're going to need you to stay here all 
weekend, to update the code so that it checks all of our customers to make sure 
none have underpaid or overpaid. I know it sucks, but unless you can think of a 
better way to check each of these new customers to see if they've underpaid, 
there's nothing we can do about it!!

Thanks for your help!!!
