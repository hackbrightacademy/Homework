Subject: *URGENT* Can you make this script better?

Hey,

We've been really impressed how you cleaned up some of our old
accounting scripts.  I found the attached "melon_info.py" script, and
I was hoping you could help.

Right now, it only tracks a melon's name, if it has seeds and its
price.  Can you help us add the ability to keep track of the flesh
color, rind color and average weight?

Also, our sales team loves to give us additional things to track at
the last minute, but i'm afraid in its current state that's going to
be a real pain to manage. So can you think about ways that we can make
this script easier to manage, if we have to constantly change the
things we are tracking?

I'm attaching two files, "melon_info.py" is the main script and
"melons.py" contains the melon data.

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead
