Subject: *URGENT* Accounting help needed!

OH NO!! The CEO has JUST informed me last night that our accounting
team was poached by Chad from Squysh.

Fortunately, I was able to get some new dev hires earlier
today from a local bootcamp. They are even less experienced than
you--but their rates are highly competitive (see attachment).

There is still an issue though. Before they officially joined today, I
ended up having to write some code myself, to basically do the job the
four accountants were doing.

I think my code looks great, but the problem is that my new jr. jr. programming
team does not understand the code I wrote.

Can you help rewrite it so that it's more understandable? I've also been
told that my code isn't very "professional" and "clean," :( so that might
be something else to work on. 


Here's what the code does:

*Counts the different amounts of each type of melon that were sold
*Calculates the revenue from those melon tallies
*Separates sales into online sales and phone sales
*Produces a fancy report to summarize the info for our CEO

Ordering each of these tasks into their own function would be a great start! 

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead
