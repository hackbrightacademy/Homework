Subject: *URGENT* Report needed for CEO!

Hey there,

We've been trying to send the melon delivery report to the CEO, but
something is broken with the script.  The guy who started it, has now
left to start his own startup, Squysh ("Lyft for WinterSquash") and
you're the only developer left on the team that knows python.

The script is printing the name of the melon where the count and total
amounts should be.  I'm hoping you can help!  We need to deliver this
report ASAP!

I've attached the code we have so far in the file produce_summary.py
along with delivery logs for the last three days.  

Thanks,
Mel

You respond and submit a new script--then you get this response back:

Hey great job so far, the CEO really appreciated that report.

One more thing--I think the code is a little hard to read because there's 
so much going on. I would appreciate it if you could do your best to 
clean up the code and remove any repetition by defining some function calls.
That should make it easier to read and run in the future.  

Sincererely,
Mel
Team Lead

P.S. I've noticed that the CEO doesn't really read an email unless it's
in all UPPER CASE.  Is there any way you could make the script print in all 
uppercase letters?
