Subject: *URGENT* Another report needed for CEO!

Hello and welcome aboard!

We here at Ubermelon believe strongly that the best way to onboard new
developers is to get them involved in our codebase immediately. 
The first assignment we need you to help us with comes directly from
the CEO himself.

He needs a report that displays sales information for Monday.  Since I
don't have time to handle this myself, I thought it'd be a great first
ticket for you. I've attached a file called process.py that seems to 
display sales information. It would help if you could read and understand 
this file, as well as make any necessary adjustments to make it display 
what Mel wants instead of the information it currently displays. 

I also went ahead and attached the latest log file, which has the
week's sales information in it. 

Thanks for your help,
Mel
Team Lead
